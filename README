Become a registered user
------------------------

There are 5 good reasons to become a registered user:

 1.  Through your registration, we can prove that people are really using
 softwarde developed at the Center for Molecular Modeling for their 
 scientific work. This facilitates the fund-raising process and guarantees 
 the continuity of these projects.

 2. It blocks spammers from unauthorized access to all online CMM Code
 services.
 
 3. A registered user can subscribe to the CMM Code mailing lists.
 
 4. A registered user is allowed to edit the wiki pages to increase the
 visibility of his/her related work.
 
 5. Registered users are allowed to submit bugs. If time permits, we will fix
 your problems in the next bug-fix release of Tracks.
