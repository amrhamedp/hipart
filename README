Short description
-----------------

HiPart is a software toolkit to analyse molecular densities with the hirshfeld 
partitioning scheme. Initially one has to create a database of pro-atom density
profiles with hi-atomdb.py. From then on, the other scripts use this database
to partition the molecular density with the Hirshfeld-I partitioning scheme.

There are three scripts that analyze molecular densities:

* hi-charges.py: just computes Hirshfeld-I chargesn, and tests how well these
  charges reproduce the ESP outside the molecule.
* hi-dipoles.py: also computes the atomic dipoles, based on the Hirshfeld-I
  weight functions, and tests how well these dipoles help in reproducing the
  ESP outside the molecule.
* hi-orbitals.py: partitions the density matrix in the SCF basis.

We assume the the calculations are done with Gaussian03 and that a working
g03.profile is located in your home directory. The code can be easily extended
with new features.

See JCP vol. 126 article 144111 (2007) for the theoretical background on 
(iterative) hirshfeld partitioning.

Software dependencies
---------------------

The following software has to be installed on your system before you can use
Tracks:
 1) Python (>=2.4, <3.0): see http://www.python.org/
 2) Numpy (>=1.0.1): see http://www.scipy.org/
 3) MolMod (>= 0.003): see http://molmod.ugent.be/code/


How to install
--------------

There are several ways to install HiPart, which are all documented
at the homepage: http://molmod.ugent.be/code/


How to get technical support
----------------------------

Technical support is availlable for all registered CMM Code users. All
information can be found at: http://molmod.ugent.be/code/


How to use
----------

See the file HOWTO for step-by-step instructions to get started.


Become a registered user
------------------------

There are 5 good reasons to become a registered user:

 1.  Through your registration, we can prove that people are really using
 softwarde developed at the Center for Molecular Modeling for their 
 scientific work. This facilitates the fund-raising process and guarantees 
 the continuity of these projects.

 2. It blocks spammers from unauthorized access to all online CMM Code
 services.
 
 3. A registered user can subscribe to the CMM Code mailing lists.
 
 4. A registered user is allowed to edit the wiki pages to increase the
 visibility of his/her related work.
 
 5. Registered users are allowed to submit bugs. If time permits, we will fix
 your problems in the next bug-fix release of Tracks.
