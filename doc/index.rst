HiPart documentation
====================

HiPart is a program to analyse the electronic structure of molecules with
fuzzy-atom partitioning methods. It now supports four schemes to define atomic
partitions: the Becke scheme [Becke1988]_, The Hirshfeld scheme
[Hirshfeld1977]_, the Iterative Hirshfeld scheme [Bultinck2007]_, and the
Iterative Stockholder Analysis [Lillestolen2008]_. Within each scheme the
following quantities can be computed: atomic charge, atomic dipoles, quality of
charges and dipoles with respect to the ESP, the atomic multipole expansion, net
populations, bond orders, spin charges and overlap matrices.

The library reference is automatically generated from the source code. As the
docstrings in the source code get more and more complete, this part will become
more and more useful.
