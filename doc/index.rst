HiPart documentation
======================================

HiPart is a program to analyse the electronic structure of molecules with fuzzy
atom methods. It now supports four schemes to define atomic partitions: the
Becke scheme [Becke1988]_, The Hirshfeld scheme [Hirshfeld1977]_, the Iterative
Hirshfeld scheme [Bultinck2007]_, and the Iterative Stockholder Analysis
[Lillestolen2008]_. Within each scheme the following quantities can be computed:
atomic charge, atomic dipoles, quality of charges and dipoles with respect to
the ESP, the atomic multipole expansion, net populations, bond orders, spin
charges and overlap matrices.
